A Vim plugin to add and remove whitespace from files for opinionated tidiness
and (hopefully) enhanced readability.

[Mirror](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3920)

# Features

* Removes whitespace at the end of lines.
* Removes sequential whitespace between words.
	* Ignores whitespace at the beginning of a line (to preserve indents).
* Adds spaces after commas in non-numeric strings.
	* Changes `foo(bar,baz,boo)` to `foo(bar, baz, boo)`.
	* Ignores large numbers (e.g. `1,234,456,789`), but not `foo(0,1)`.
* Operates on the entire buffer by default, or a range if provided.
* Aggressive mode for when you know better than the safeguards.

# Options

* `g:WhiteWash.auto` - Enabled rules are run whenever `:WhiteWash` is called.
```vim
" Set to 0 to disable a rule
let g:WhiteWash.auto.commas = 0
let g:WhiteWash.auto.sequential = 0
let g:WhiteWash.auto.trailing = 0
```

* `g:WhiteWash.aggressive` - Define which rules should run with aggressive mode
  by default.
```vim
let g:WhiteWash.aggressive.commas = 1
let g:WhiteWash.aggressive.sequential = 1
```

# Commands

* `:WhiteWash` - Run all enabled WhiteWash rules.
* `:WhiteWashAggressive` - Run all enabled WhiteWash rules in aggressive mode.
* `:WhiteWashCommas` - Run only the commas rule (respects aggressive setting).
* `:WhiteWashSequential` - Run only the sequential rule (respects aggressive
  setting).
* `:WhiteWashTrailing` - Remove trailing whitespace.
